## Description

This method is an extension of GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) model. 

Context similarity, as a complement to spatial proximity, is introduced in geographically weighted regressions. An attention-based framework is developed to calculate the context similarity between locations.


## How to use

- Run the `run-cv.py` file with python3. Hyperparameters and options can also be set in this file.
- Modify the `models.py` file if you want to change the network structure.
